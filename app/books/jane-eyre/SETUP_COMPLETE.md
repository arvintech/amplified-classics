## ðŸ‘¥ For Concurrent Development:

### Multiple Contributors Can Work Simultaneously!

**The System:**
- Each chapter = separate `.ts` file in `/chapters/`
- No conflicts when working on different chapters!
- Use branches: `jane-eyre/chapter-X-yourname`

**Workflow:**
1. Claim a chapter (communicate with team)
2. Pull latest: `git pull origin main`
3. Create branch: `git checkout -b jane-eyre/chapter-5-yourname`
4. Copy template: `_templates/ChapterNextTemplate.ts` (for Chapter 2+)
5. Fill in data for your chapter
6. Test locally: `npm run dev`
7. Commit & push your branch
8. Create Pull Request for review

**No Merge Conflicts Because:**
- Each person edits their own chapter file
- Files are independent
- Only need to import in `[chapter]/page.tsx` after merge

### Example for 3 Contributors:

- **Person A**: Working on Chapter 5 â†’ `chapters/chapter-5.ts`
- **Person B**: Working on Chapter 8 â†’ `chapters/chapter-8.ts`  
- **Person C**: Working on Chapter 12 â†’ `chapters/chapter-12.ts`

All three can work simultaneously without conflicts!

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps:

1. **Test Chapter 1**: View it live, verify it renders correctly
2. **Create Chapter 2**: Use `ChapterNextTemplate.ts`
3. **Assign Chapters**: Distribute to contributors
4. **Set Deadlines**: Timeline for completion
5. **Review Process**: How chapters get approved

## ðŸŽ¯ Master Project Structure:

This is **amplified-classics** - the production platform.

**Other Project** (jane-erye-temp):
- Staging/testing environment
- We created data files there first
- Now copied to master project

## ðŸ”§ If Issues Occur:

**TypeScript errors?**
- Check imports use `@/app/lib/types/book.types`
- Verify all required fields from ChapterData interface

**Chapter not showing?**
- Import in `[chapter]/page.tsx`
- Add to `chapters` array
- Check chapter number in filename matches

**Styling issues?**
- Uses same CSS variables as wuthering-heights
- Check `globals.css` for theme vars

## âœ¨ Success Criteria:

- [x] Chapter 1 data file complete
- [x] Dynamic routing working
- [x] All template sections included
- [ ] Test on localhost (YOU DO THIS)
- [ ] Verify all sections render
- [ ] Check mobile responsive
- [ ] Deploy to production
