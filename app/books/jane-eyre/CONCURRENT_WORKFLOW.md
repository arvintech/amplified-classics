## 🚀 How 5 People Can Work on Jane Eyre at Once

### Step 1: Claim Your Chapters

Use GitHub Issues, Trello, or a shared document:

```
Chapter 2  - Alice (in progress)
Chapter 3  - Bob (in progress)
Chapter 4  - Carol (in progress)  
Chapter 5  - David (in progress)
Chapter 6  - Emma (in progress)
```

### Step 2: Each Person's Workflow

**On Their Own Machine:**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo (first time only)
git clone https://github.com/your-org/amplified-classics.git
cd amplified-classics

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 4. Create your branch
git checkout -b jane-eyre/chapter-3-bob

# 5. Copy the template
cp app/books/_templates/ChapterNextTemplate.ts app/books/jane-eyre-new/chapters/chapter-3.ts

# 6. Work on your chapter
# Edit: app/books/jane-eyre-new/chapters/chapter-3.ts

# 7. Test locally
npm run dev
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/books/jane-eyre-new/chapter-3

# 8. Commit your work
git add app/books/jane-eyre-new/chapters/chapter-3.ts
git commit -m "Add Jane Eyre Chapter 3 analysis"

# 9. Push your branch
git push origin jane-eyre/chapter-3-bob

# 10. Create Pull Request on GitHub
# Team reviews → Approve → Merge to main
```

### Step 3: No Conflicts!

**Why this works:**
- Alice edits: `chapter-2.ts`
- Bob edits: `chapter-3.ts`
- Carol edits: `chapter-4.ts`
- David edits: `chapter-5.ts`
- Emma edits: `chapter-6.ts`

**Different files = No conflicts!**

## 📁 What Each Contributor Needs

### Required Files on Their Machine:

1. The repository cloned
2. Node.js installed (v18+)
3. Their assigned chapter template
4. Access to push branches

### They DON'T Need to Edit:

- ❌ `[chapter]/page.tsx` (only edit during setup)
- ❌ `config.ts` (only edit if adding metadata)
- ❌ Other people's chapter files

---

## 🔄 Integration Process

### After Each Chapter is Complete:

**Maintainer (you) integrates:**

```typescript
// In: app/books/jane-eyre-new/[chapter]/page.tsx

// Add import:
import { chapter3 } from '../chapters/chapter-3'

// Add to array:
const chapters: any[] = [
  chapter1,
  chapter2,
  chapter3,  // ← New!
  // ...
]
```

**Or contributors can do this in their PR!**

## 📋 Quality Control Checklist

### Before Merging Each Chapter:

- [ ] Follows ChapterNextTemplate structure
- [ ] All required sections present
- [ ] TypeScript compiles (no errors)
- [ ] Renders correctly in browser
- [ ] Spelling/grammar checked
- [ ] Modern adaptation is thoughtful
- [ ] Discussion questions are open-ended
- [ ] AI responses are substantial (300-500 words)

## 🎨 Templates to Use

### For Chapter 1:
- **Template:** `/app/books/_templates/Chapter1Template.ts`
- **Includes:** seriesOpening, speedLearningNotice
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### For Chapters 2-38:
- **Template:** `/app/books/_templates/ChapterNextTemplate.ts`  
- **Simpler:** No series opening, no speed learning notice
- **Status:** Ready to copy!

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Fast Development:

1. **Batch similar chapters:** 
   - Give one person Chapters 2-4 (Lowood arrival)
   - Another person Chapters 10-12 (Rochester introduction)

2. **Use AI assistance:**
   - Contributors can use Claude/ChatGPT to help draft sections
   - BUT: Must review, edit, and ensure quality

3. **Template filling order:**
   - Start with summary (easiest)
   - Then characters & quotes
   - Then themes & techniques
   - Finally amplified discussion (hardest)

4. **Parallel work streams:**
   - **Stream A:** Chapters 1-13 (Childhood & arrival at Thornfield)
   - **Stream B:** Chapters 14-26 (Romance & betrayal)
   - **Stream C:** Chapters 27-38 (Wandering & resolution)

## 🚨 Avoiding Problems

### Communication is Key:

- **Use a shared document** to track who's doing what
- **Update status** when you start/finish
- **Ask questions** in team chat if stuck
- **Review each other's work** before merging

### Git Best Practices:

```bash
# Always pull before starting work
git pull origin main

# Use descriptive branch names
git checkout -b jane-eyre/chapter-7-analysis

# Commit often
git commit -m "Add character analysis for Chapter 7"

# Push regularly (don't lose work!)
git push origin jane-eyre/chapter-7-analysis
```
