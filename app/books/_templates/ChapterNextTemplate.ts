Opening paragraph: Validate what they discovered and explain its significance.

**What This Technique Accomplishes:**

**Point 1 - Specific Function**
- Subpoint with details
- How it works in this specific passage
- Why the author chose this approach

**Point 2 - Broader Pattern**
- How this moment fits into larger patterns
- Connections to other moments in novel
- Thematic significance

**Point 3 - Character/Plot Significance**
- What this reveals about character
- How it advances plot or conflict
- Emotional/psychological truth

**Victorian Context:**

Explain the historical/cultural context that makes this technique meaningful. What would Victorian readers have understood? What social/cultural norms does this engage with?

**Critical Readings:**

**Modern Parallel:**

Connect to contemporary life, media, or experiences students recognize.

**You just discovered [big insight about literature/life]!**`

// GUIDELINES FOR READING MOMENTS
// ==========================================

/*
READING MOMENT SELECTION CRITERIA:

Choose moments that:
1. Teach a specific literary technique
2. Reveal character psychology
3. Advance thematic understanding
4. Present moral/philosophical dilemmas
5. Demonstrate Victorian social dynamics
6. Connect to students' lived experience

PROGRESSIVE QUESTIONING:

Question 1: OBSERVE
- "What do you notice?"
- "What words/images stand out?"
- "What's happening here?"

Question 2: CONNECT
- "How does X relate to Y?"
- "Compare this to earlier moment"
- "Put these two pieces together"

Question 3: INTERPRET
- "What does this pattern reveal?"
- "Why might the author choose this?"
- "What's the deeper meaning?"

AMPLIFY STRUCTURE:

1. Name the discovery (validate their insight)
2. Explain the technique/concept
3. Provide Victorian context
4. Offer multiple critical perspectives
5. Connect to modern experience
6. Celebrate the insight

TONE:

- Enthusiastic and validating
- "You discovered!" not "You should have noticed"
- Treat students as fellow readers making insights
- Academic but accessible
- Builds confidence in literary analysis

LENGTH:

Each Reading Moment amplification: 300-500 words
Total chapter: 5-6 Reading Moments = 1500-3000 words
Plus structure sections: ~500 words
Total chapter file: ~2000-3500 words

This is leaner than Chapter 1 but still pedagogically rich.
