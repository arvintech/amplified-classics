# Amplified Classics Chapter Templates

## Overview

This directory contains the **definitive templates** for creating chapters in Amplified Classics. There are **two distinct templates** based on pedagogical needs:

1. **Chapter1Template.ts** - For opening chapters (Chapter 1 only)
2. **ChapterNextTemplate.ts** - For all subsequent chapters (Chapters 2+)

---

## When to Use Each Template

### Chapter1Template.ts
**Use for:** First chapter of any book

**Purpose:** Opening chapters need comprehensive world-building, extensive context-setting, and thorough pedagogical scaffolding. Readers are entering a new world and need:
- Full character introductions
- Setting establishment
- Theme introduction
- Genre conventions explanation
- Historical context
- Literary technique foundations

**Based on:** Current Wuthering Heights Chapter 1 structure

**File size:** ~600-900 lines

---

### ChapterNextTemplate.ts
**Use for:** Chapters 2 through final chapter

**Purpose:** Subsequent chapters focus on **Reading Moments** pedagogy—interactive, discovery-based learning around specific textual moments. Less scaffolding needed since world is established.

**Based on:** Jane Eyre Chapter 20 structure

**File size:** ~400-600 lines

---

## Key Structural Differences

### Chapter1Template includes:
✅ Comprehensive summary (4 paragraphs)
✅ Full character development section (all introduced characters)
✅ Key quotes with analysis (3-4 quotes)
✅ IA Analysis (themes + literary techniques)
✅ Modern adaptation
✅ Thematic threads (that will run through novel)
✅ Discussion questions (6 questions)

**Total sections:** 9 major sections

---

### ChapterNextTemplate includes:

✅ **Reading Moments** (5-6 moments) - THIS IS THE CORE
✅ Chapter closing (resolution, cliffhanger, thematic shift)
✅ Quick discussion prompts (2-3 rapid questions)
✅ Connections (look back, look forward, thematic echo)
✅ Educator note (teaching focus, common misreadings)

**Total sections:** 7 focused sections

**Primary pedagogy:** Reading Moments (Notice → Explore → Amplify)

---

## Reading Moments Structure

The **Reading Moments** are the pedagogical heart of subsequent chapters:

### 1. Notice
- Quote the key passage
- Set up context
- Ask: "What catches your attention?"

### 2. Explore  
- **3 progressive questions** that guide discovery:
  - Q1: Observe (What do you see?)
  - Q2: Connect (How do pieces relate?)
  - Q3: Interpret (What does it mean?)

### 3. Amplify
- **Validate discovery:** "You've Discovered: [Technique]"
- **Explain significance:** What the technique does
- **Victorian context:** Historical/cultural background
- **Multiple perspectives:** Different critical readings
- **Modern parallel:** Contemporary relevance
- **Celebrate insight:** "You just discovered..."

## Examples

### Good Reading Moment (from Jane Eyre Ch. 20):

**Notice:** "The minister begins: 'If either of you know any impediment...' A voice speaks: 'The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment.'"

**Explore:**
1. "This is the dramatic moment readers anticipated. How does Brontë create maximum tension?"
2. "Rochester tries to proceed anyway—why does he think he can override the objection?"
3. "Who hired the solicitor? How do they know Rochester's secret?"

**Amplify:** "You've Discovered: Legal/Divine Intervention at Crucial Moment..."
[Explains Gothic convention, legal mechanism, dramatic structure]

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Making Chapter 1 too brief (needs full world-building)
❌ Making Chapters 2+ as long as Chapter 1 (should be leaner)
❌ Telling students what to think (guide them to discover)
❌ Ignoring Victorian context (essential for understanding)
❌ Writing only for advanced students (scaffold for all levels)
❌ Using academic jargon without explanation
❌ Forgetting to connect to modern experience

## Questions?

These templates are living documents. If you discover patterns or approaches that work well, update the templates to incorporate them.

**Principle:** Every chapter should amplify students' intelligence—help them see what they might have missed, validate what they discovered, and build confidence in their ability to read deeply.
