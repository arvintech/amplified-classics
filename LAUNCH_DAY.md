> "We are going for a moonshot. We expect to fail but will measure how near we are to success. 111 books by April 1st 2026. Who knows if we may overshoot to Mars. But let's take this journey, as this was meant for us. It's all about the opportunity to fail, and fail again because success may be the end of it. And we surely don't want it to end."

## 💭 THE PHILOSOPHY WE EMBRACE

### We Believe:
- ✨ The journey matters more than the destination
- ✨ Failure is the greatest teacher
- ✨ Progress beats perfection
- ✨ Ship daily, iterate always
- ✨ Measure everything, judge nothing
- ✨ Celebrate every failure that teaches
- ✨ Joy in the attempt, not just the outcome

### We Accept:
- 🌙 We probably won't hit exactly 111
- 🌙 Some books will be rough
- 🌙 We'll want to quit sometimes
- 🌙 People will think we're crazy
- 🌙 **And that's all perfect**

---

## 🌟 WHY THIS MATTERS

This isn't about 111 books.

It's about:
- **Building** a production system that scales
- **Learning** how to fail productively
- **Creating** something meaningful
- **Pushing** boundaries of what's possible
- **Sharing** classic literature with the world
- **Proving** that ambitious attempts have value
- **Inspiring** others to chase moonshots
- **Enjoying** every single day of the journey

## 💬 FINAL WORDS

This is the day we chose to attempt something magnificent.

Not because it's easy.  
Not because we'll definitely succeed.  
But because the attempt itself is worthwhile.

**111 books or bust!**  
(Actually, any number is perfect because we're going to learn so much!)

See you in the JOURNAL tomorrow for Day 2.
