## Design Philosophy

The Chapter 1 template is designed to:

1. **Orient new readers** to both the book and the Amplified method
2. **Layer complexity** from simple (summary) to complex (critical thinking)
3. **Serve multiple audiences**: students, teachers, independent learners
4. **Build skills progressively**: comprehension ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí synthesis
5. **Connect past to present**: make classics relevant
6. **Create momentum**: hook readers to continue

---

## Notes for Implementation

### When Creating Chapter 1 for a New Book:

1. **Start with the basics**: Number, title, reading time, pages
2. **Write the summary** first - this clarifies your thinking
3. **Identify 3-5 key quotes** that matter most
4. **Choose 5-7 terms** (mix of vocabulary and literary concepts)
5. **Create 3-5 amplified discussions** on the most important/complex aspects
6. **Design ONE strong critical thinking exercise** - quality over quantity
7. **Make modern connections** authentic, not forced

### Common Patterns:

- **Amplified discussions** typically run 300-500 words each
- **Discussion questions** should have no single "right" answer
- **Modern adaptations** work best with specific, relatable scenarios
- **Critical thinking exercises** should require synthesis, not just comprehension

### Voice and Tone:

- Direct, conversational, but intellectually rigorous
- Explain without condescending
- Challenge without intimidating
- Connect without oversimplifying

---

## Customization Points

Different books may emphasize different sections based on:

- **Genre**: Gothic novels need more genre context
- **Historical period**: Some need more historical background
- **Narrative complexity**: Some need more help with structure
- **Target audience**: AP students vs. general readers

The template is flexible - use what serves the text and the reader.

## üéØ Summary: Chapter 1 Only Sections

When creating a **ChapterNextTemplate** (for Chapters 2+), **REMOVE** these two sections:

### 1. `seriesOpening` üö´
**Why Chapter 1 Only**: This section introduces the reader to the Amplified Classics method itself. It's meta-instruction that explains:
- What the Amplified features are
- How to use them effectively
- What makes this approach different

**Once explained in Chapter 1, readers already understand the method, so this section is not needed in subsequent chapters.**

### 2. `speedLearningNotice` üö´
**Why Chapter 1 Only**: This section teaches readers HOW to use the Amplified Discussion sections:
- Try answering questions first
- Then expand and read the analysis
- Compare your thinking to the expert analysis

**After Chapter 1, readers already know how to engage with the material, so this meta-instruction is redundant.**

---

## ‚úÖ All Other Sections Remain

**All 15 other sections** should appear in every chapter (2+):
1. Basic Chapter Information
2. Summary
3. Terms to Know
4. Characters
5. Quotes
6. IA Analysis
7. Modern Adaptation
8. Thematic Threads
9. Discussion Questions
10. Amplified Discussion
11. Educator Resources
12. Critical Thinking Exercise
13. **Why Literature Matters** ‚≠ê NEW - *Placed at the end*
14. Next Time Teaser (except final chapter)

---

*This template is based on Wuthering Heights Chapter 1 and represents the Amplified Classics approach to making literature accessible, engaging, and intellectually rich.*
