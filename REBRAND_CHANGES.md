## Brand Consistency

### ✅ Aligned with IA Brand
- Uses "Intelligence Amplified" (the full brand name)
- Uses "Amplified" as shorthand
- Never uses "AI" or "Artificial Intelligence" in user-facing text

### ✅ Preserved Technical Accuracy
- Internal variable names (`getAIGuidance`) remain unchanged
- Code comments still reference implementation details
- API prompts use clear technical language

---

## Visual Identity

The feature now communicates:
1. **"Amplified"** = Enhanced, augmented, made more powerful
2. **"Intelligence Amplified"** = Human intelligence enhanced by technology
3. **Not "AI"** = Avoiding generic commodity positioning

This distinguishes the platform from generic "AI tools" and emphasizes the **human-centered augmentation** philosophy.

---

## Key Messaging

### Old (Generic AI)
> "Ask AI Assistant"
> "Get AI-powered guidance"

### New (Intelligence Amplified)
> "Amplify This Question"
> "Get Intelligence Amplified teaching guidance"

The new messaging:
- **More distinctive** (proprietary brand vs. commodity term)
- **More empowering** (amplify *your* intelligence vs. rely on AI)
- **More accurate** (reflects the philosophy: tools that amplify human capability)

---

## User Experience Impact

### Before
Users see "AI" and think: *"Another generic AI tool"*

### After
Users see "Intelligence Amplified" and think:
- *"This is enhancing MY intelligence"*
- *"This is a specific methodology, not generic AI"*
- *"This amplifies my teaching, not replaces it"*

---

## Brand Positioning

### Intelligence Amplified = Philosophy
"You were never meant to be replaced. You were meant to be amplified."

This rebrand reinforces that:
1. **Teachers remain central** (not AI-replaced)
2. **Students develop their intelligence** (not outsource to AI)
3. **Technology amplifies human capability** (not substitutes for it)
