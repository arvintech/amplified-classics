# Notice → Explore → Amplify

## A Revolutionary Method for Teaching Literature

---

## The Problem

**Traditional literature discussion often fails because it asks the wrong question first:**

> "What does the weather symbolize in the opening of *Jane Eyre*?"

**Student response:** *Silence. Fear. Disengagement.*

**Why?** Because this question:
- Assumes students noticed the weather
- Assumes they recognized it as significant
- Tests knowledge rather than inviting discovery
- Makes students perform rather than explore
- Positions teacher as examiner, not guide

---

## The Solution: Notice → Explore → Amplify

A three-phase collaborative reading method that **honors student observation, guides genuine exploration, and amplifies with expert insight**.

### **Phase 1: 🔍 Notice**
**What students observe, unprompted**

> "Several readers noticed the opening weather description. Let's look at it together: 'There was no possibility of taking a walk that day...cold winter wind...clouds so sombre...rain so penetrating.' What words catch your attention?"

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ **Low pressure** — "What did YOU notice?"
- ✅ **Collective** — "Several readers noticed..."
- ✅ **Invitation** — "Let's look together"
- ✅ **No wrong answers** — just noticing

**Result:** Students engage because they're not being tested. They're being **heard**.

---

### **Phase 2: 💭 Explore Together**
**Guided questions that deepen thinking**

Once students have noticed, guide them deeper with **exploratory questions**:

1. "What emotions or feelings do these weather words make YOU think of?"
2. "Now, what's happening to Jane in this scene? What's her situation?"
3. "Put the weather and Jane's situation next to each other. What do you notice?"

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ **Scaffolded** — questions build on each other
- ✅ **Personal** — "What do YOU think?"
- ✅ **Collaborative** — "Let's put these together"
- ✅ **Inductive** — students discover the pattern

**Result:** Students do the intellectual work. They **discover** pathetic fallacy rather than being **told** about it.

---

### **Phase 3: ⚡ Amplify**
**Expert insight at the right moment**

After students have explored, **amplify** with literary expertise:

> **You've Discovered: Pathetic Fallacy**
>
> You just discovered that the weather mirrors Jane's emotional state! This technique has a name in literature: **pathetic fallacy**—when the environment reflects psychological states.
>
> **Why This Matters:**
> 
> Brontë's brilliant choices:
> - Opens with weather, not action (creates mood first)
> - The weather physically HURTS ("penetrating," "nipping")—like Jane's treatment hurts
> - It's November—dying season—Jane's childhood is dying
> - Gothic atmosphere establishes this will be psychologically intense

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ **Affirming** — "You discovered..."
- ✅ **Naming** — gives scholarly vocabulary
- ✅ **Contextualizing** — historical/literary background
- ✅ **Connecting** — links to broader themes

**Result:** Students feel **smart and validated**. Teacher expertise **enhances** rather than **replaces** student discovery.

## Why This Works: The Psychology

### **Traditional Method (Interrogative):**
```
Teacher asks → Student performs → Teacher evaluates
         ↓
   Anxiety, silence, disengagement
```

### **Notice → Explore → Amplify (Collaborative):**
```
Student notices → Teacher guides → Student discovers → Teacher amplifies
         ↓
   Confidence, engagement, genuine learning
```

## The Teacher's Role Transforms

### **From Examiner to Guide**

| Old Role | New Role |
|----------|----------|
| "What does X symbolize?" | "What did you notice about X?" |
| Testing recall | Inviting observation |
| Gatekeeping knowledge | Curating moments worth noticing |
| Evaluating answers | Guiding exploration |
| Lecturing | Amplifying discoveries |

### **Teacher Credibility Through:**
1. **Knowing what's worth noticing** — curating powerful literary moments
2. **Asking questions that deepen thinking** — scaffolding exploration
3. **Providing expert context** — amplifying at the right time
4. **Connecting student insights to scholarship** — validating discoveries

**Result:** Your expertise is **more visible**, not less. But it guides rather than gatekeeps.

## Real Example: The Opening of *Jane Eyre*

### **Traditional Approach:**

**Teacher:** "Why does Brontë open with weather? What does it symbolize?"

**Student:** *[Silence or guessing]* "Um...it's sad?"

**Teacher:** *[Explains pathetic fallacy for 10 minutes]*

**Student:** *[Copies notes, forgets next week]*

---

### **Notice → Explore → Amplify:**

**🔍 NOTICE:**
**Teacher:** "As you read the opening, what words or images caught your attention? What made you pause or slow down?"

**Student:** "The weather description was really intense—'penetrating rain,' 'sombre clouds'..."

**Teacher:** "Yes! Several people noticed that. Let's look at it together..."

---

**💭 EXPLORE:**
**Teacher:** "What emotions do these weather words create for you?"

**Students:** "Cold, miserable, oppressive, sad..."

**Teacher:** "Good. Now what's happening to Jane in this moment?"

**Students:** "She's excluded from the family, isolated, reading alone..."

**Teacher:** "Interesting. Put the weather and Jane's situation side by side. What do you notice?"

**Student:** "Oh! The weather matches how she feels—cold and shut out!"

**Teacher:** "Exactly! You just made a connection between external environment and internal emotion..."

---

**⚡ AMPLIFY:**
**Teacher:** "What you discovered has a name in literature: **pathetic fallacy**—when weather or environment mirrors psychological states. Brontë does this throughout the novel, but especially here at the opening. Why do you think she chose to open with weather rather than action or backstory?"

**Students:** *[Now engaged, building on their own discovery]*

## The "Amplify" Difference

### **Why "Amplify" instead of "Ask AI"?**

**"Ask AI"** implies:
- ❌ Outsourcing thinking
- ❌ AI replaces student work
- ❌ Shortcut to answers
- ❌ Technology > human insight

**"Amplify"** implies:
- ✅ Enhancing student discovery
- ✅ Adding expert context
- ✅ Making connections visible
- ✅ Human insight + technological support

## Implementation: How Teachers Use This

### **In Class:**
1. **Before reading:** "As you read Chapter 1, mark anything you notice—a word, image, moment that catches your attention."
2. **During discussion:** Use Notice prompts to surface what students saw
3. **Explore phase:** Use guided questions (provided in IA Edition)
4. **Amplify:** Reveal expert insight (or use the "Amplify This Moment" button)

### **For Homework:**
- Students explore one moment independently
- Write brief response: "I noticed...I wonder...I discovered..."
- Come to class ready to share

### **Assessment:**
- Students demonstrate **close reading** (noticing)
- Students demonstrate **analytical thinking** (exploring)
- Students demonstrate **scholarly awareness** (connecting to amplified insights)

## The Philosophical Foundation

### **Intelligence Amplification, Not Artificial Intelligence**

This method embodies the **IA philosophy**:

> AI didn't arrive to replace intelligence. It arrived to remind us what it means.

**The human skills we're amplifying:**
- 👁️ **Observation** — noticing what others miss
- 🤔 **Curiosity** — wondering why something matters
- 🔗 **Connection** — linking observations to patterns
- 💬 **Articulation** — expressing discoveries
- 🏛️ **Context** — understanding historical/literary significance

**Technology's role:**
- Curating moments worth noticing
- Providing scaffolded questions
- Offering expert context on demand
- Connecting student insights to scholarship

**Result:** Students become **better readers**, not dependent on technology.

## Comparison to Traditional Methods

### **Socratic Method:**
- ❌ Can feel interrogative
- ❌ Teacher controls entirely
- ✅ But: values student discovery

### **Lecture:**
- ❌ Passive learning
- ❌ No student voice
- ✅ But: provides expert knowledge

### **"What did you think?" Discussion:**
- ❌ Too open-ended
- ❌ No scaffolding
- ✅ But: values student perspective

### **Notice → Explore → Amplify:**
- ✅ Student observation valued (like Socratic)
- ✅ Expert knowledge provided (like lecture)
- ✅ Student perspective invited (like open discussion)
- ✅ **But: Structured, collaborative, and affirming**
