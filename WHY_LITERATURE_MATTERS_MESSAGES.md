# Why Literature Matters - Message Collection

## Overview

This document lists all 50 rotating one-liners about literature's importance in the age of STEM. These messages appear **at the end of each chapter** as a powerful closing reminder that leaves students with motivation and perspective after completing the chapter.

## Implementation

**File**: `app/lib/literature-matters-messages.ts`

**Usage**:
```typescript
import { getLiteratureMessageByChapter } from '@/app/lib/literature-matters-messages'

// In chapter data:
whyLiteratureMatters: getLiteratureMessageByChapter(1) // Chapter number
```

**How it works**:
- Each chapter number generates a consistent but different message
- Uses modulo operation to cycle through 50+ messages
- Same chapter number always shows the same message (consistency)
- Different chapters show different messages (variety)

## Student Response

This feature addresses a common student question: **"Why do I need to read literature when I'm going into STEM?"**

By seeing a different compelling answer **at the end of each chapter**, students:
- Leave with a motivating thought that reinforces the value of what they just studied
- Are reminded of literature's ongoing relevance at the moment of accomplishment
- Get exposed to multiple perspectives on literature's value across chapters
- See reading as complementary to (not competing with) their STEM interests
- Build cumulative motivation as they progress through the book

**Placement at the end is strategic**: Rather than justifying before they've engaged with the content, we reinforce value after they've experienced it. This creates positive association and sustained motivation.
