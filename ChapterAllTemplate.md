## Section-by-Section Tips for Later Chapters

### Summary
- ‚úÖ Reference previous events: "After Lockwood's unsettling first visit..."
- ‚úÖ Show progression: "The conflict between X and Y intensifies..."
- ‚úÖ Set context: "We now shift to..."

### Characters
- ‚úÖ Focus on NEW developments, not repeating Chapter 1 descriptions
- ‚úÖ Show change: "We now see a different side of..."
- ‚úÖ Track relationships: "Their dynamic shifts when..."

### Themes
- ‚úÖ Show evolution: "The theme of isolation deepens..."
- ‚úÖ Connect to previous chapters: "Building on the introduction of..."
- ‚úÖ Note turning points: "This chapter marks a shift in how..."

### Amplified Discussion
- ‚úÖ Can compare to earlier chapters
- ‚úÖ Can analyze character/theme development
- ‚úÖ Can explore narrative structure across chapters

### Modern Adaptation
- ‚úÖ Can build on previous modern scenarios
- ‚úÖ Can show how situation escalates
- ‚úÖ Can parallel chapter-to-chapter progression

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Don't:
1. **Repeat Chapter 1 content** - Build on it, don't rehash it
2. **Ignore previous chapters** - Show connections and development
3. **Forget to update chapter numbers** - Especially in `whyLiteratureMatters`
4. **Write in isolation** - Each chapter should feel connected to the whole
5. **Include seriesOpening or speedLearningNotice** - Those are Chapter 1 only!

### ‚úÖ Do:
1. **Reference earlier events** - Help readers track the narrative
2. **Show development** - How do things change from previous chapters?
3. **Build complexity** - Deepen analysis as the story progresses
4. **Maintain consistency** - Use same thematic threads across chapters
5. **Update all placeholders** - Don't leave `[brackets]` in the final version
