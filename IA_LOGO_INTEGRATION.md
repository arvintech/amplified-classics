# IA Logo Integration Complete ✅

## 📍 Where to Place Your Logo File

**IMPORTANT:** Place your uploaded IA logo file here:
```
/public/ia-logo.png
```

The file should be named exactly `ia-logo.png` (or update the references in IALogo.tsx if using a different name).

## ✨ What's Been Integrated

### 1. **IALogo Component** (`/app/components/IALogo.tsx`)
Reusable component with two exports:

#### `<IALogo />`
Full logo display with size options:
- `size="small"` - 80x80px
- `size="medium"` - 150x150px (default)
- `size="large"` - 250x250px
- `size="full"` - 500x500px

#### `<IABadge />`
Small badge with logo icon + "IA Edition" text
- Perfect for chapter headers
- Uses 16x16px logo icon
- Green themed to match your logo

### 2. **IA Landing Page** (`/ia`)
✅ Logo added prominently at the top of the hero section
- Positioned above the headline
- Medium size (150x150px)
- Animated entrance with framer-motion
- Establishes brand identity immediately

### 3. **Chapter 1 - Jane Eyre** (`/books/jane-eyre/chapter-1`)
✅ IABadge replaces generic badge
- Shows mini IA logo + "IA Edition" text
- Green color scheme matching your branding
- Appears right after "Chapter 1" badge
- Clearly identifies IA-enhanced content

import { IABadge } from '@/app/components/IALogo'

// Full logo
<IALogo size="medium" />

// Small badge
<IABadge />
```

### Customization options:

```tsx
// Custom styling
<IALogo 
  size="large" 
  style={{ margin: '2rem auto' }}
  className="custom-class"
/>

// Badge with custom style
<IABadge 
  style={{ background: 'rgba(30, 86, 49, 0.2)' }}
