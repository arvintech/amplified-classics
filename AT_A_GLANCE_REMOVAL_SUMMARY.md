# At A Glance Section - Removal Summary

## Decision

The "At A Glance" section has been **completely removed** from Amplified Classics templates. 

**Reason**: It ruins the experience of human reading by providing spoilers and reducing the discovery process that makes literature engaging.

## Impact on User Experience

### Before (with At A Glance):
- Students saw spoilers before reading
- Key events revealed upfront
- Mood and atmosphere given away
- Reduced sense of discovery

### After (without At A Glance):
- Students experience authentic reading discovery
- No spoilers or pre-revealed plot points
- Natural engagement with the text
- Literature feels more like a human experience, less like a study guide

## Philosophy

**Amplified Classics enhances literature, but should never replace the core reading experience.**

The "At A Glance" section, while pedagogically useful for reference, created a "CliffsNotes" feeling that undermined the joy of reading. Students should discover plot, mood, and key events through reading, not through summary boxes.

Our amplified sections (analysis, discussion, exercises) remain powerful **after** or **during** reading, but we preserve the sanctity of first encounter with the text.

## Technical Status

✅ All TypeScript files compile without errors
✅ All linter checks pass
✅ Templates are ready for use
✅ Documentation updated
✅ Wuthering Heights Chapters 1-2 updated as reference examples
