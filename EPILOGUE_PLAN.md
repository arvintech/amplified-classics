## Key Themes to Emphasize in Design

### **The Teacher as Amplifier**
> "A teacher of literature doesn't replace the text ‚Äî they *extend* it."

**Visual:** Wave/frequency metaphor, amplifier icons

### **The Student as Author**
> "Every reader is an unfinished writer. Every analysis is an act of creation."

**Visual:** Pen transforming into growing tree, co-creation imagery

### **The Amplified Classroom**
> "The amplified classroom doesn't resist technology; it redeems it."

**Visual:** Human + AI working together, not AI replacing human

### **The Enduring Purpose**
> "Someone will still need to teach what it means to **read.**"

**Visual:** Books + consciousness, eternal flame of understanding

## The Bigger Context

In the debate about **AI in education**, most voices say:
- ‚ùå "AI will replace teachers" (dystopian)
- ‚ùå "Ban AI from classrooms" (reactionary)
- ‚ùå "Use AI to automate grading" (transactional)

**Amplified Classics says:**
- ‚úÖ "AI reminds us what human intelligence truly is"
- ‚úÖ "Use AI to amplify human capacity, not replace it"
- ‚úÖ "Teaching literature becomes MORE vital, not less"

This epilogue is your stake in the ground.

It says: **We've thought deeply about what we're building, and why it matters for humanity.**
