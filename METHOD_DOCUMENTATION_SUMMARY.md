## ðŸ’¡ **Key Talking Points**

### **The Hook:**
> "Traditional literature discussion asks 'What does X symbolize?' and gets silence. We ask 'What did YOU notice?' and get engagement."

### **The Innovation:**
> "Notice â†’ Explore â†’ Amplify transforms students from performers into discoverers while amplifying teacher expertise at exactly the right moment."

### **The Philosophy:**
> "Intelligence Amplification, not Artificial Intelligence. AI didn't arrive to replace intelligenceâ€”it arrived to remind us what it means."

### **The Proof:**
> "Experience it live: Six moments from Jane Eyre Chapter 1, each using the full three-phase method. [Link to Chapter 1]"

## ðŸŽ¯ **Elevator Pitches**

### **30-Second Version:**
> "We've developed a three-phase method that transforms 'What does this symbolize?' into 'What did you notice?' Students share observations, teachers guide exploration, then expert insight amplifies discoveries. More engagement, better retention, and teacher expertise that enhances rather than replaces student thinking."

### **2-Minute Version:**
> "Traditional literature discussion creates anxiety: students freeze when asked 'What does X symbolize?' We've reimagined the entire process with Notice â†’ Explore â†’ Amplify. First, students share what THEY noticedâ€”low pressure, no wrong answers. Second, teachers guide exploration with scaffolded questions that help students discover patterns. Third, expert insight amplifies their discoveries with scholarly vocabulary and context. Result: students engage deeply, retain longer, and develop genuine analytical skills. Teacher expertise doesn't diminishâ€”it shines at exactly the right moment. Try it live with Jane Eyre Chapter 1 on our site."

### **5-Minute Version:**
*(Use sections from NOTICE_EXPLORE_AMPLIFY.mdx + live demo + Q&A)*
