---

## ❌ **The Old Way**

**Teacher:** "What does the weather symbolize in *Jane Eyre*?"

**Student:** *[Silence]*

**Result:** Anxiety, disengagement, forgetting

---

## ✅ **The New Way**

### 🔍 **NOTICE**
**Teacher:** "What did YOU notice in the opening?"

**Student:** "The weather words were really intense..."

**Why:** Low pressure. No wrong answers. Student voice first.

---

### 💭 **EXPLORE**
**Teacher:** "What emotions do those words create? What's happening to Jane? Put them together—what do you see?"

**Student:** "Oh! The weather matches how she feels!"

**Why:** Student discovers the pattern. Evidence-based thinking.

---

### ⚡ **AMPLIFY**

**Student:** *[Feels smart, remembers]*

**Why:** Expert knowledge enhances discovery. Teacher credibility shines.

## **The Results**

| Metric | Result |

## **Why "Amplify"?**

Not "Ask AI" (outsourcing) → **"Amplify"** (enhancing)

Intelligence Amplification philosophy:
> AI didn't arrive to replace intelligence.  
> It arrived to remind us what it means.
