## 📊 **Key Talking Points**

### **The Problem We Solve:**
> "What does X symbolize?" creates anxiety and silence. Students feel tested, not invited.

### **Our Innovation:**
> Notice → Explore → Amplify honors what students see first, then guides discovery, then amplifies with expertise.

### **The Philosophy:**
> Intelligence Amplification, not Artificial Intelligence. AI didn't arrive to replace intelligence—it arrived to remind us what it means.

### **The Result:**
> Students engage more deeply, retain longer, and develop genuine literary analysis skills. Teachers facilitate discovery while their expertise shines.

## 🎨 **Visual Assets Needed**

### Diagrams to Create:
1. **Three-Phase Flow Chart**
   ```
   🔍 NOTICE → 💭 EXPLORE → ⚡ AMPLIFY
   (Student observes) → (Teacher guides) → (Expert enhances)
   ```

2. **Old vs New Comparison**
   ```
   Traditional: Teacher asks → Student performs → Teacher evaluates
   New Method: Student notices → Teacher guides → Student discovers → Teacher amplifies
   ```

3. **Benefits Wheel**
   - Center: "Notice → Explore → Amplify"
   - Spokes: Engagement, Retention, Rigor, Confidence, Collaboration

4. **Teacher Role Evolution**
   ```
   From Examiner → To Guide
   From Gatekeeper → To Curator
   From Lecturer → To Amplifier
   ```

## 🎓 **Pedagogical Foundations**

This method draws on:

1. **Socratic Method** — values student discovery
2. **Constructivism** — students build knowledge actively
3. **Gradual Release of Responsibility** — "I do, we do, you do"
4. **Culturally Responsive Teaching** — honors student voice
5. **Notice & Wonder** — math/science inquiry transferred to literature

**Innovation:** Combines these proven approaches with AI-enhanced scaffolding and expert amplification at scale.

## 🎯 **Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)**

> "We've developed a three-phase method for teaching literature that transforms 'What does this symbolize?' into 'What did you notice?' Students share observations, teachers guide exploration through scaffolded questions, then expert insight amplifies their discoveries. Result: more engagement, better retention, and teacher expertise that enhances rather than replaces student thinking. Want to see it in action?"
