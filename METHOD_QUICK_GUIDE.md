## The Three-Phase Method for Collaborative Reading

---

## 🔍 Phase 1: NOTICE

**What it is:** Students share what caught their attention while reading

**Example prompt:**
> "Several readers noticed the opening weather description. Let's look at it together: 'There was no possibility of taking a walk that day...cold winter wind...clouds so sombre...rain so penetrating.' What words catch your attention?"

**Why it works:**
- No wrong answers (just noticing)
- Low pressure (invitation, not interrogation)
- Honors student observation
- Creates shared text focus

---

## 💭 Phase 2: EXPLORE

**What it is:** Teacher-guided questions that scaffold discovery

**Example questions:**
1. "What emotions or feelings do these weather words make YOU think of?"
2. "Now, what's happening to Jane in this scene? What's her situation?"
3. "Put the weather and Jane's situation next to each other. What do you notice?"

**Why it works:**
- Students do the analytical work
- Questions build on each other
- Discovery vs. transmission
- Evidence-based thinking

---

## ⚡ Phase 3: AMPLIFY

**What it is:** Expert literary context provided at the perfect moment

**Example amplification:**
> **You've Discovered: Pathetic Fallacy**
> 
> You just discovered that the weather mirrors Jane's emotional state! This technique has a name in literature: **pathetic fallacy**—when the environment reflects psychological states.
> 
> **Victorian Context:** Weather as emotional mirror was central to Gothic literature. Brontë uses it to tell us: this isn't just a story about a girl, it's about deep psychological experience.

**Why it works:**
- Affirms student discovery
- Provides scholarly vocabulary
- Adds historical/literary context
- Teacher expertise enhances (doesn't replace)

### Traditional:
```
Teacher asks → Student guesses → Teacher evaluates
              ↓
         Silence, anxiety
```

### Notice → Explore → Amplify:
```
Student notices → Teacher guides → Student discovers → Teacher amplifies
                   ↓
         Engagement, confidence, learning
```
