## Book Links

### Free Reading
- **Project Gutenberg:** https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1260
- Complete, unabridged text
- Multiple formats (HTML, EPUB, Kindle, Plain Text)
- Public domain

### Purchase Options
- **Powell's Books:** Penguin Classics Edition (ISBN: 9780141441146)
- **Amazon:** Penguin Classics Edition (ISBN: 0141441143)

## Positioning

The component appears:
1. **After** the chapter content and study materials
2. **After** the "Continue to Next Chapter" button
3. **Before** the chapter navigation footer

This placement ensures readers engage with your content first, then are naturally prompted to purchase or read the original.

## Next Steps

### To Add the Book Cover Image:
1. See `HOW_TO_ADD_BOOK_COVER.md` for detailed instructions
2. Place book cover image in `/public` folder
3. Either:
   - Update the default prop in `ReadOriginalText.tsx`, OR
   - Pass `bookCoverImage` prop to each chapter component

### To Roll Out to All Chapters:

For chapters 3-38, add these two lines:

**1. Import the component:**
```tsx
import { ReadOriginalText } from '@/app/components/ReadOriginalText'
```

**2. Add before the navigation (around line 1500+):**
```tsx
{/* Read the Original Text */}
<ReadOriginalText />
```

### Quick Script (Optional)
If you want to batch-update all chapters, I can create a script to automatically add the component to chapters 3-38.

## Revenue Potential

This feature can generate passive income through:
- **Amazon Associates** - 1-10% commission on purchases
- **Powell's Affiliate Program** - Commission on sales
- Drives traffic to legitimate retailers
- Supports independent bookstores (Powell's)
