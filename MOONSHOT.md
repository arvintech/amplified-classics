- ✨ **Have faith in the Divine** (purpose beyond productivity)

- ✅ Quality threshold (all books must meet minimum standard)
- ✅ Team morale check-ins (weekly)
- ✅ Permission to adjust (can slow down if needed)
- ✅ Pace yourself (marathon, not sprint)

### Energy Management:
- Sprint weeks (high output)
- Recovery weeks (consolidation)
- Theme weeks (focus on one genre/era)
- Variety (mix long/short books)

## 🌟 WHY WE'RE DOING THIS

Not for the 111 books.

For:
- **The learning**: Building production systems at scale
- **The challenge**: Pushing what's possible
- **The journey**: Every day is an adventure
- **The failures**: Our greatest teachers
- **The process**: Iterating toward excellence
- **The community**: Sharing classic literature
- **The legacy**: Making classics accessible
- **The fun**: Because we can!

## 🎯 THE ACTUAL GOAL

> Build a system so good, we never want to stop at 111.

If we hit 111 and think "let's do 111 more," we've succeeded.

If we hit 50 and think "we learned everything we needed," we've succeeded.

If we hit 200 and think "this is just the beginning," we've succeeded.

**The number doesn't matter. The journey does.**
